  I have worked for Architectural and Non-Architectural Organisations in various
  capacities. I have developed strong design methodologies, management skills
  and systems, and a strong work ethic. I have worked in small and large project
  teams on a variety of projects both in Jamaica and Trinidad, with local and
  overseas consultants. Between 2005 to 2008 I worked as a part of the Executive
  of TMC Architecture Limited, Trinidad, to develop, acquire and maintain ISO
  Certification, becoming one of the first Architectural firms to achieve this
  certification. I hold a Masters of Architecture, Bachelor of Arts in
  Architectural Studies and an Associate Degree in the Built Environment. I am
  also a member of several professional bodies, such as: the Trinidad and Tobago
  Institute of Architects (TTIA) and the Project Management Institute (PMI).
