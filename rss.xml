            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have worked for Architectural and Non-Architectural Organisations in various capacities. I have developed strong design methodologies, management skills and systems, and a strong work ethic. I have worked in small and large project teams on a variety of projects both in Jamaica and Trinidad, with local and overseas consultants. Between 2005 to 2008 I worked as a part of the Executive of TMC Architecture Limited, Trinidad, to develop, acquire and maintain ISO Certification, becoming one of the first Architectural firms to achieve this certification. I hold a Masters of Architecture, Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies and an Associate Degree in the Built Environment. I am also a member of several professional bodies, such as: the Trinidad and Tobago Institute of Architects (TTIA) and the Project Management Institute (PMI).</p>]]></description>
